# pytorch-foundations-and-projects

**PyTorch implementations, course assignments, and production-ready mini-projects demonstrating core deep learning architectures, training pipelines, and reproducible experiments.**

## Overview

This repository collects my coursework from the DeepLearning.AI & Coursera PyTorch series, along with extended projects and reproducible experiments. It focuses on clear implementations, modular training pipelines, documented experiments, and best-practice engineering (testing, CI, environment, and code quality).

Highlights:
- Clean, annotated PyTorch implementations (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, custom layers)
- Reproducible training pipelines and experiment logging
- Assignment notebooks + production-ready scripts
- Unit tests and CI for core components
